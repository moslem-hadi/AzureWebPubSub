I'm bad at wroting read me!  
basically what this project does, is connecting to Azure web pubsub, gets a websocket connection string with a userId, then in frontend connects to that websocket.  
you can subscribe to any type of messages defined with 'Event' property in 'MessageBase' class.
Just run the backend, and then fronend with 'ng serve'. Just remember to specify the Azure web pubsub connection string in the appSettings.    
byeeeee!
